As challenged by a [tweet](https://twitter.com/Ocramius/status/680817040429592576), this library extracts validation
rules and filters from a html form and validates submitted user data against it.

It's pretty crazy what you have to do to get a form build in frameworks. Create a lot of php classes for elements,
validation, etc. So why not build a html form and use the standard element attributes to extract the validation rules
and filters. Together with some powerful html compliant data attributes you can create forms, customize validation
rules and filters in one place.
